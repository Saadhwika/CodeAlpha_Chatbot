# CodeAlpha_Chatbot
chatbot done using python
A simple rule-based chatbot built with Python for my CodeAlpha internship (Task 2). This chatbot handles basic greetings like "hello" and "how are you", and exits on "bye". Implemented using conditional logic in a Jupyter Notebook, it demonstrates foundational Python skills like input handling and control flow. Future improvements could include adding NLP or expanding its responses.
